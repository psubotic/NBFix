"""
Heuristic, best-effort type/shape tagging across cell reassignment -
built to plug the specific gap `build_dependency_edges`
(src/nbfix/llm/context_builder.py) can't: it tells you a cell *depends*
on a name another cell defines, but nothing about whether a reassignment
along the way actually changed what that name *means*. That's exactly the
`cross_cell_semantic` bug shape (e.g. `data = [1,2,3]` then later
`data = len(data)` - same name, list becomes int, a downstream
`data.append(...)` crashes) - and it's also exactly the shape
`def_use.py`'s `unbound_names` computation is structurally blind to
(read-before-write in the same cell cancels out of a plain set
difference), so fixing the edge-tracking wouldn't help here even if it
were fixed. This sidesteps the problem instead: track a coarse type tag
per name across cells, and flag it when a reassignment changes the tag.

Not a real type inference engine - a small, closed set of tags inferred
from purely local syntax (literals, and a knowledge-base of well-known
constructors/functions with predictable return types, same style as
DataLeakAnalysis's resetKB/taintKB/etc.). Anything not recognized tags as
`None` (unknown), which must stay a real, distinct outcome - conflating
"unknown" with "unchanged" would manufacture false positives on any code
this heuristic doesn't understand.

Deliberately not wired into NBFix.all_analyses/constants.py yet - a
standalone function returning the same Result/ErrorInfo shape the other
four analyses produce, callable directly (e.g. by
scripts/benchmark_llm.py, or fed straight into
context_builder.build_full_notebook_context's deterministic_findings
param) without needing the CFG-level fixpoint/abstract-interpretation
machinery (Analysis/Runner/F_transformer) the other four - and
dependency_analysis.py - use for incremental re-analysis. Type-tag
inference doesn't need CFG-level precision (it only ever looks at a
single Assign node's RHS expression), so _compute_type_tags below uses a
lighter, purpose-fit fixpoint instead: iterate the whole-notebook set of
plain-Assign statements to a fixpoint rather than a single pass, so
`_infer_tag`'s name-to-name lookups resolve correctly regardless of
which cell's text comes first - genuinely order-independent now, not
just labeled that way (an earlier version of this module claimed
order-independence while actually doing a single ID-ordered pass -
see _compute_type_tags's docstring for why that was wrong and what
replaced it). No incremental re-run story needed yet. Promote to a full
Analysis subclass if it earns a permanent spot (CLI -a flag, live
JupyterLab diagnostics).

    Order-independent type-tag inference across the whole notebook.

    The previous version of this walk processed cells in a single pass
    in cell-ID order, so `_infer_tag`'s `ast.Name` lookups (`a = b` needs
    b's tag) could only ever resolve a name whose *own* defining cell
    happened to come earlier in the notebook's text. That's the exact
    same wrong assumption `context_builder.build_dependency_edges` used
    to make (see that module's comment, and experiments.md findings
    10-11) - cell-ID order isn't execution order, so `c = [1]` in cell 5
    and `a = c` in cell 2 should resolve just as well as the reverse.

    Fixed by iterating the whole-notebook inference to a fixpoint instead
    of a single pass: every plain `name = <expr>` Assign in the notebook
    is re-evaluated repeatedly (each pass sees the previous pass's
    resolved tags) until nothing changes, so a chain resolves correctly
    regardless of which cell text comes first. Bounded at
    len(triples) + 1 passes - enough for any acyclic chain to fully
    propagate; a genuine reference cycle (`a = b; b = a`) just never
    resolves past None, which is the correct, conservative outcome for
    something truly circular.

    Returns name -> list of (cell_id, tag) for every plain-Assign
    definition site of that name, in its fully fixpoint-resolved tag -
