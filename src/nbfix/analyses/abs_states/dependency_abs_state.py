    """
    Abstract state for DependencyAnalysis (see dependency_analysis.py):
    tracks which names are known to be defined "so far" along a
    propagation path through the notebook, and *which cell* most
    recently (along this specific path) defined each one - the
    dependency-graph analogue of CodeImpactAS.impacted_variables, minus
    the staleness levels. defined_vars maps name -> the cell_id that
    provided it; that provenance matters once K > 2 lets propagation
    chain through more than one intermediate cell (see
    dependency_analysis.py's _DIRECT_EDGE_DEPTH comment) - without it, a
    cell several hops downstream would get attributed back to the
    original seed cell for *every* name reachable along the path, not
    just the ones the seed itself actually defines. Concretely: seed
    A defines x; B reads x and defines y; C reads y. C's dependency is on
    B (which defined y), not on A - A never even appears in C's own
    UDA.unbound_final. Tracking provenance per name is what keeps that
    distinction correct instead of collapsing every hop back to the seed.
