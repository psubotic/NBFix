class DetectApiSequenceEvent(Event):
    """
    LLM-based check for whether any cell in the notebook violates a
    library API's call-order contract (e.g. calling .predict() on a
    scikit-learn estimator that was never .fit()) - scenario 1 of the
    two use cases discussed for this bug class: warn before the user
    runs a cell, not a separate "scan for all paths" feature (deferred -
    see this module's sibling api_sequence_prompts.py docstring).

    Scans the whole notebook in a single LLM call, not one target cell
    at a time - an earlier version took a cell_index and checked just
    that cell, but the only real caller (manager.ts's
    _scanAllCellsForApiSequence) always needed every cell checked
    anyway, making N single-cell calls per scan pure latency waste.

    focus_cell (optional) narrows the prompt to that cell's dependency-
    connected component instead of the whole notebook - see
    api_sequence_context_builder.py's docstring. checked_cells is set
    after execute() runs, to every cell_id actually *considered* -
    which, thanks to the method-call filter, can be larger than what
    actually went into the prompt (a component with no method calls at
    all is confidently resolved as "no violation" without ever asking
    the LLM, but still counts as checked). The caller needs this to know
    which cells' *prior* findings are safe to discard versus which are
    untouched by a narrowed scan (see dispatch.py/handlers.py for how
    this rides back to the frontend, and manager.ts's _sendChangeCell
    for the merge that depends on it). A plain attribute, not part of
    Result, since Result is a generic shape every event returns and this
    is specific to this one event's narrowing.

    Cares about execution history (not_yet_run in the context), but
    needs no explicit original_code parameter the way
    DetectStaleCellsEvent does - it isn't diffing against what a cell
    used to contain, just checking whether each cell's own current code
    has actually executed yet. Reads notebook_IR as-is at call time; no
    special ordering relative to RunCellEvent.

    Never mutates nbfix's state - same discipline as DetectBugsEvent/
    DetectStaleCellsEvent (both have their own regression tests for
    this).
