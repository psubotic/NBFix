"""
A dependency graph computed the way the NBLyzer paper (Subotic, Milikic,
Stojic - "A Static Analysis Framework for Data Science Notebooks", ICSE-SEIP
'22) actually specifies it, instead of context_builder.py's
build_dependency_edges shortcut.

The gap this closes: build_dependency_edges walks cells in a single pass
in cell-*ID* order, tracking a running last_definer map that only ever
gets updated *after* a cell is visited. That silently assumes cell ID
order is execution order - which the paper's own motivating example
(Section 1, Figure 1) explicitly rejects: "cells, regardless of their
order in the notebook, can be executed... in *any* given sequence." A
name read in cell 3 but only defined in cell 4 is a completely ordinary,
detectable dependency under that model (cell 4's post-state satisfies
cell 3's pre-condition, full stop) - but build_dependency_edges can never
see it, because by the time it reaches cell 3 in its single forward pass,
cell 4 hasn't been visited yet. That gap is exactly what NBFix's
`order_dependent` bug class lives in (see experiments.md), and it's a
limitation of that one implementation, not of dependency graphs in
general.

The paper's real model (Definition 3.1, "Cell Propagation Dependency
Graph"): an edge c_i -> c_j exists iff phi(sigma#_ci, pre_cj) - cell i's
abstract post-state satisfies cell j's pre-condition - discovered by
propagating abstract state across the notebook to a fixpoint (or a
bounded depth K), not by a single ID-ordered scan. That's exactly what
this module builds, reusing the *same* fixpoint engine
(runner.runners.Runner.inter_fixpoint_runner) StaleCellAnalysis already
uses - same shape (Analysis subclass + AbstractState subclass), just a
different abstract domain: "which names are defined so far" instead of
"how stale is this variable." Concretely:

- DependencyAS (abs_states/dependency_abs_state.py) tracks defined names
  along a propagation path (no staleness levels needed).
- phi_condition here is a plain non-empty-intersection check
  (`bool(current & pre)`), deliberately weaker than StaleCellAnalysis's
  `pre <= current` (full subset) - a cell can depend on several different
  upstream cells for different names, so satisfying *one* shared name
  with a candidate source cell is enough to justify visiting it; the
  fixpoint runner's own recursion produces the actual per-name binding via
  DependencyAS.condition when the candidate cell's own CFG is walked.

Standalone, like analyses/type_shape_analysis.py - not wired into
NBFix.all_analyses/constants.py. build_fixpoint_dependency_edges produces
the same dict[int, set[int]] shape as context_builder.build_dependency_edges,
so it's a drop-in for DetectBugsEvent's dependency_edges override param.
