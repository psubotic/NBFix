# No natural "line" for a staleness finding the way a real code bug has

# need cell_id downstream, never a real source location).

# stale_prompts.STALE_SYSTEM_PROMPT now asks for a bare cell_id list, not
# a {cell_id, message} object per finding - dropping the free-text
# explanation was measured to cut latency ~3x (see that module's
# docstring). There's no per-cell explanation to surface anymore, so
# every finding gets this fixed message instead.
